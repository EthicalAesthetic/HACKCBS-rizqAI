# Authentication

RizqAI delegates identity, password hashing, OAuth, email delivery, access-token
issuance, refresh-token rotation, and reset-token expiry to Supabase Auth. The
backend never stores passwords, reset tokens, access tokens, or refresh tokens.

## Environment

Copy the root `.env.example` to `.env` and set:

- `DATABASE_URL`: Supabase PostgreSQL connection string. Use the pooler URL for
  deployed/serverless workloads when appropriate.
- `JWT_SECRET`: long random server-only secret used to sign access JWTs. Never
  expose it to the frontend.
- `SUPABASE_URL`: project URL.
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: publishable anon key used for user-scoped Auth calls.
- `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`: server-only key used to revoke all sessions at
  logout. Never expose it to the frontend.
- `AUTH_REDIRECT_URL`: allow-listed OAuth callback URL.
- `PASSWORD_RESET_REDIRECT_URL`: allow-listed password reset URL.

## Supabase setup

1. Run the Alembic migration from the repository root:

   ```text
   alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
   ```

   Alembic creates the application tables, profile trigger, indexes, foreign
   keys, and RLS policies.    Alembic is the only supported schema migration path for this application;
   do not run ad-hoc SQL schema copies against the same database.
2. In **Authentication > URL Configuration**, add the redirect URLs used by
   `AUTH_REDIRECT_URL` and `PASSWORD_RESET_REDIRECT_URL`.
3. Enable Email provider in Supabase. RizqAI's local signup verification prints
   a six-digit OTP in the backend terminal; it does not send that OTP by email.
   The OTP expires after 10 minutes and is limited to five attempts. The
   application stores only a salted PBKDF2 hash and never stores the raw OTP
   or the signup password. Supabase Auth owns password hashing in `auth.users`.
4. Under **Authentication > Providers**, enable Google and GitHub.
5. In Google Cloud OAuth, add the Supabase provider callback URL shown by the
   Supabase dashboard. Add the Google client ID/secret to Supabase.
6. In GitHub OAuth, create an OAuth app with the same Supabase provider callback
   URL, then add its client ID/secret to Supabase.

Email/password signup and login use the application `users` table. Passwords
are stored only as salted PBKDF2 hashes. Access tokens are signed JWTs and
refresh-token hashes plus revocation state are stored in `auth_sessions`.
The backend starts OAuth in implicit mode and the frontend callback accepts the
short-lived Supabase access token returned in the callback URL hash. A
code-based callback remains supported for deployments configured for PKCE. The
backend validates the resulting token with Supabase before creating the local
session.

## API

All auth responses are JSON. Session responses contain the access and refresh
tokens because the caller must hold them to authenticate subsequent requests.
The server does not log them. Send the access token as:
`Authorization: Bearer <access-token>`.

- `POST /auth/signup/request-otp` with `{ "email", "password" }`; the OTP is
  printed only in the backend terminal.
- `POST /auth/signup/verify-otp` with `{ "email", "password", "otp" }`
  to create the confirmed Supabase user and receive a session.
- `POST /auth/login` with `{ "email", "password" }`
- `POST /auth/refresh` with `{ "refresh_token" }`; replace the old session with
  the returned rotated session.
- `POST /auth/logout` with a bearer token; all sessions for that user are
  revoked using the service role API.
- `GET /auth/oauth/google` or `/auth/oauth/github`; open the returned URL.
- `GET /auth/callback?code=...`; exchanges a one-time OAuth code.
- `POST /auth/password/recover` with `{ "email" }`. The response is deliberately
  identical whether the email exists.
- `POST /auth/password/update` with a bearer token from the Supabase recovery
  session and `{ "password" }`. Supabase makes recovery sessions and reset
  tokens expiring and single-use.

`/analysis/stream` is protected by the application bearer-token dependency, which validates
signature, expiry, revocation, and claims remotely. Every conversation query is
scoped to the authenticated user ID. Supabase RLS provides a second
authorization boundary for PostgreSQL access.

## Local testing

Install backend dependencies with `pip install -r backend/requirements.txt`,
apply the migration to a development Supabase project, and run:

```text
uvicorn main:app --app-dir backend --reload
```

Useful migration commands:

```text
alembic -c backend/alembic.ini current
alembic -c backend/alembic.ini history
alembic -c backend/alembic.ini upgrade head
alembic -c backend/alembic.ini downgrade -1
```

Set `DATABASE_URL` to the Supabase PostgreSQL URL before running these
commands. Alembic loads the URL from the same environment configuration as the
backend. Application startup no longer calls `create_all`; migrations must be
applied before deployment.

Run the focused tests with:

```text
pytest backend/tests -q
```

The health endpoint is intentionally public for container health checks; it
does not access AI functionality.
